# Minesweeper
Hello fellow developer!

The objective of this project was to create an interactive game using:
* Typescript
* SCSS
* HTML.

The styling to kept to minimum to give a feel of the original minesweeper game.
Since this is my first project as a TS developer any inputs on optimising the code will be greatly appreciated. Please pop it in the issues tab.
Use the link below to checkout the live game.

Enjoy!

_P.S. if you have never played minesweeper before, there is a help button added to the game._
